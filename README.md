Creating a Bar Chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable of 2016 IPL DATA 

# IPL 2016 Data Visualization

This project is a beginner-level data analysis task where I used Python to create simple visualizations from the IPL 2016 data.  
The objective was to understand how to represent categorical and continuous variables using bar charts and histograms.

## Dataset
- Data: IPL 2016 match data  
- Columns include: Team, Player, Team_Runs, Player_runs etc.  
- Data is stored in a CSV file (teams_200plus_2016.csv, players_100plus_2016.csv)  

## Task
- Load the dataset into Python  
- Perform a basic exploration of the data  
- Create:
  - A **Bar Chart** to visualize categorical data (e.g., Matches played by each team, Total runs by players, etc.)   

## Steps Performed
1. Imported dataset using Pandas  
2. Cleaned and prepared the data (removed unnecessary columns, handled missing values if any)  
3. Created bar charts for categorical variables (e.g., matches by team, runs scored, runs scored by players)  
4. Plotted visualizations using Matplotlib  

## Key Insights
- Bar charts clearly showed differences between teams in terms of matches and performances  
- Histograms helped identify the distribution of runs and scores in the season  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Upload the (teams_200plus_2016.csv, players_100plus_2016.csv) file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run the notebook to generate the bar charts and histograms  

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on practice in:  
- Reading and exploring a dataset  
- Visualizing categorical and continuous variables  
- Using bar charts and histograms to identify patterns in sports data
